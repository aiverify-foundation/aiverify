## AI Verify 2.0 Is Comming!

## Announcing AI Verify 2.x â€“ A New Era of AI Governance!

We are thrilled to announce the upcoming release of AI Verify 2.x, a groundbreaking update that will revolutionize the way you validate and govern AI systems. This new version is packed with major enhancements designed to provide more flexibility, efficiency, and scalability.

### What's New in AI Verify 2.x?

- **Modular Architecture**: The toolkit has been re-architected to be more modular, allowing for easier integration and customization.
- **Independent Test Algorithms**: Each test algorithm can now be run as a separate Python module, giving you the freedom to use and develop algorithms independently.
- **Redesigned Backend Test Engine Worker**: The backend test engine worker has been completely redesigned for improved performance and reliability.
- **New Frontend Workflows**: Experience a more intuitive and streamlined user interface with our newly designed frontend workflows.
- **Veritas Integration**: Including Veritas into AI Verify allows financial institutions to meet common safety baseline and financial testing requirements.
- **Improved support for Computer Vision**: More evaluations to be included to support different types of use cases.

In the meantime, we have released an alpha version of the new AI Verify 2.x with the modular architecture and independent test algorithms that can be easily installed via pip. Refer to the [aiverify-test-engine directory](./aiverify-test-engine/README.md) for installation instructions or check out the individual plugins of interest in the `stock-plugins` directory.

Stay tuned for more updates as we get closer to the release date. We can't wait for you to experience the new and improved AI Verify 2.x!

## Introduction

Welcome to AI Verify! AI Verify is launched under the [AI Verify Foundation](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=20230607_AI_Verify_Foundation_GitHub), a subsidiary under the IMDA.

[AI Verify](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/what-is-ai-verify/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=20230607_AI_Verify_GitHub) is an AI governance testing framework and software toolkit that validates the performance of AI systems against a set of internationally recognised principles through standardised tests. AI Verify is consistent with international AI governance frameworks such as those from European Union, OECD and Singapore.

It is a single integrated toolkit that operates within an enterprise environment. It can perform technical tests on common supervised learning classification and regression models for most tabular and image datasets. It however does not define AI ethical standards and does not guarantee that any AI system tested will be free from risks or biases or is completely safe.

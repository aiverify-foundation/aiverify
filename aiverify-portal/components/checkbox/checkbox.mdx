<Title>Checkbox React Component</Title>

Under the hood, the Checkbox component uses the native HTML input element with type "checkbox" and adds some custom styling.
The component only renders the input and label. The `checked` state is managed internally by React.
All the styling is handled in the `checkbox.module.css` file. Colors styling which are bounded to theme use Tailwind CSS classes.

<Meta of={CheckboxStories} />
<Primary />

Below are the key `props` that can be passed to the Checkbox component.
All other `props` that the standard HTML input element supports are also accepted.
<Controls />

If testing the component using React Testing Library, the recommended selector is `screen.getByRole('checkbox', { name: /your checkbox/i });`
where "your checkbox" is the value of the `label` prop.

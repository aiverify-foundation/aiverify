      services offered and the information used in the process. This can be
      achieved through information in the product details, application forms,

      as part of the customerâ€™s application.

      requirements for AIDA driven decisions will be achieved by using existing
      practices where applicable or by establishing a suitably enhanced common
      practice across both (AIDA and non-AIDA driven outcomes) where required.
      This decision will be taken prior to operationalising the model.

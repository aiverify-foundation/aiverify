      The potential harm that is most relevant to the at risk groups identified
      in F1 is the potentially higher cost of insurance for them if they are
      incorrectly assessed as ineligible by the system. Another harm identified
      was of a surcharge on all insured to cover the cost of those that were
      incorrectly assessed as eligible by the system. The potential benefits
      that are particularly relevant to groups identified in F1 are cheaper
      insurance and the convenience of simplified underwriting to reduce
      mortality protection gap.

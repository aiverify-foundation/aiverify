        <li>
          it will be more difficult for customers to apply for credit products
          successfully, who have a loan application declined that go on their
          financial record;
        </li>
        <li>
          they may default on a loan that they would have otherwise not
          acquired.

      The potential benefits to customers are:

        <li>
          they can learn more about loan products and meet their unfulfilled
          needs;

          the marketing call provides them with the opportunity to apply for
          credit products without waiting in a queue at a branch or on the
          phone.

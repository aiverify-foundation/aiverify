      For customer marketing, Proactive communication allows the customer to
      know about product eligibility criteria, the product offer and various
      terms and conditions via the website or during telemarketing outreach.
      Since the choice to apply or not is made by the customer, reactive
      communication (customer facing), other than confirmation of the chosen
      offer, is not required. Please note, the outcome of credit decision is out
      of scope for customer marketing.

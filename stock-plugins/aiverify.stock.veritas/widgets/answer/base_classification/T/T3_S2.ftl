<#--What is the extent of internal transparency for individual AIDA use casesï¼Ÿ-->

<div>
    The extent to which such transparency is needed, and the audience for the same, will be determined by the materiality of the AIDA use case.
    Different audiences will require different levels of technical detail from the explanations.
    The following transparency requirements applying to different audiences serve as an example.

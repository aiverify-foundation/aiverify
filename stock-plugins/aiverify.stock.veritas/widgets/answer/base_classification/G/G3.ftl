 The materiality framework is used to tier the risk of AIDA systems so that systems with higher levels of risk are prioritised in terms of focus and resources.
 Factors to determine the materiality of AIDA systems can include the following:
     <ul>
        <li>Extent of automation in the AIDA driven decision making process. </li>
        <li>Complexity of the AIDA model.  </li>
        <li>Severity and probability of impact on different stakeholders, including the individuals affected.  </li>
        <li>Monetary and financial impact.  </li>
        <li>Regulatory impact. </li>
        <li>Reputational risk.  </li>
        <li>Use of personal data. </li>
     </ul>

<#--Who are the owners and stakeholders for the commitments? Refer to the following key concepts explanation and the table.-->
<ul>
<li>
<b>Stakeholders: </b>Individuals, committees, organisations, and governments can be stakeholders in accountability.
To define a stakeholder, the first step is to define an individual owner for each specification.
This should be a person or a committee of known individuals. Then define the stakeholders for each specification.
This is who the owners will need to be accountable to. Stakeholders can be in/external individuals, committees, public
or private organisations, government entities, or any party that stands to experience benefit or harm from a commitment.

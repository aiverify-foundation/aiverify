          stakeholder, the first step is to define an individual owner for each
          specification. This should be a person or a committee of known
          individuals. Then define the stakeholders for each specification. This
          is who the owners will need to be accountable to. Stakeholders can be
          in/external individuals, committees, public or private organisations,
          government entities, or any party that stands to experience benefit or
          harm from a commitment.

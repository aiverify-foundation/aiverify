<#--What are the principles，commitments and specifications for your use case? Refer to the following key concepts explanation and the table.-->

<ul>
<li><b>Commitments: </b>A professed obligation that explains how a principle will be implemented in a specific context.
Commitments are individual-, societal-, and system-level promises an organisation makes to its customers and other stakeholders that are informed by values, core concepts, and principles.
</li>
<li><b>Specification: </b>A set of quantifiable assessments, or metrics, that can measure the extent to which commitments have been met.
There may be more than one specification per commitment. This avoids unintentional overfitting to a metric that doesn’t represent the whole outcome.
Additionally, it is most relevant to measure the effects of commitments over time, so binary specifications, such as yes/no measurements,
should be avoided as they don’t allow for trendlines. Commitments, with meaningful specifications are the foundation of accountability.</li>
    </ul>
The following table is an example. Remember to add a priority – low(L), medium(M), or high(H) – to each commitment.
Prioritisation scores serve to prioritise resources and optimise for higher priority commitments when outcomes might be in conflict.

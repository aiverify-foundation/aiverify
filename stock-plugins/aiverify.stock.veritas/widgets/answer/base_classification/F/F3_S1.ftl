<#-- F3.1 After a consistent and reasonable identification process, what are the fairness objectives that fit the commercial objectives and decision outcomes of the system? -->

<div>
The fairness objective of AIDA system is use case specific and should be defined by the AIDA system Owner (usually the FSI process business owner).
The objective must be made mathematically precise to be encoded into an AIDA system.
The choice of fairness objectives for an AIDA system depends on the systemâ€™s exact purpose, the consequences of its operation,
the people affected, and the values of the people responsible for its design.
That choice will also likely involve making tradeoffs between different kinds of fairness for different people affected by the system.

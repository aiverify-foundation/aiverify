    Different sources of bias can be mitigated using different techniques.
    <ul>
        <li><b>Representation bias</b>:Collect more data of underrepresented groups. Statistical techniques include data reweighing, up-sampling or down-sampling.</li>
        <li><b>Measurement bias</b>: Obtain another, more reliable source of data and improve quality of instruments/sources of data collection in light of related best-practices.</li>
        <li><b>Pre-processing bias</b>:Understand the reason behind anomalies and fixing the root causes. Another potential way to mitigate is augmentation or guidance from external data to make informed data treatments.</li>
        <li><b>Proxy bias</b>:Change to a more relevant proxy, where the new proxy feature comes with an evidence based justification of causality, rather than a mere association with intended property to be measured.</li>
        <li><b>Historic decision bias</b>:Gather more appropriate (potentially recent) data and adjust the selection criteria for the disadvantaged groups, building synthetic datasets that remove existing data bias, and testing AIDA model biases.</li>
        <li>Other quantitative ways include preprocessing,inprocessing and postprocessing bias mitigation algorithms.</li>
    </ul>

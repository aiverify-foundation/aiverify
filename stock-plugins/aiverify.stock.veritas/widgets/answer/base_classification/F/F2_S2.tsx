        If the AIDA system outcome is assistive (such as assessing if an
        individual should get automated access to a financial product) then the
        most important harms to consider usually are whether at-risk groups are
        incorrectly denied assistance more often than others. Whereas if the
        AIDA system outcome is punitive (such as assessing if an individual is
        fraudulent), then most important harms to consider usually are whether
        at-risk groups incorrectly receive the punitive outcome more often than
        others.

        Checking if the distribution of benefits to at-risk groups is comparable

        the groups at risk of disadvantages.

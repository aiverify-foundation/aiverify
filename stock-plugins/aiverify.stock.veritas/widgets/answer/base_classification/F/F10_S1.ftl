<#--F10.1 What bias mitigation techniques are applied?-->

<div>
    Pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing algorithms are available to mitigate the bias and improve fairness.
    Here the postprocessing mitigation method in the form of constrained balanced accuracy is applied.
    The mitigation approach selects separate classification thresholds for groups for which it aims to optimise fairness.

<#--F2.2 What are the most important harms and benefits to consider for the groups as at risk of disadvantages in F1? -->
<div>

If the AIDA system outcome is assistive (such as assessing if an individual should get automated access to a financial product)
then the most important harms to consider usually are whether at risk groups are incorrectly denied assistance more often than others.
Whereas if the AIDA system outcome is punitive (such as assessing if an individual is fraudulent),
then most important harms to consider usually are whether at risk groups incorrectly receive the punitive outcome more often than others.

Checking if the distribution of benefits to at risk groups is comparable to the target population is one way to identify important benefits for the groups as at risk of diadvantages.

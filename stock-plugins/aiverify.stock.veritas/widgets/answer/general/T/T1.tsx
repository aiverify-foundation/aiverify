      The extent of external transparency is determined based on the influence
      of the use case’s outcome on one or more of the following factors:
      <ul>
        <li>Deny access to products/services.</li>
        <li>Limit access to products/services.</li>
        <li>
          Provide access to products/services that may be unsuitable for the
          customer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In some circumstances, external transparency requirements can be reduced
        if the following situation occurs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fraud detection.</li>
        <li>Financial crime detection and compliance.</li>
        <li>Susceptible to gaming the bank’s systems or processes.</li>
        <li>
          Loss of bank’s intellectual property, resulting in loss of competitive
          advantage.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      The fairness objective of AIDA system is use case specific and should be
      defined by the AIDA system Owner (usually the FSI process business owner).
      The objective must be made mathematically precise to be encoded into an
      AIDA system. The choice of fairness objectives for an AIDA system depends
      on the system’s exact purpose, the consequences of its operation, the
      people affected, and the values of the people responsible for its design.
      That choice will also likely involve making tradeoffs between different
      kinds of fairness for different people affected by the system.

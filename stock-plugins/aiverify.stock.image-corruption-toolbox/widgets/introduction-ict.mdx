  <h3 className="c-primary">Robustness (Image Corruptions) Toolbox</h3>
  <span>
    <i>Robustness Toolbox</i> generates corrupted images based on the given test samples and computes the accuracy of the model.  
  </span>
  <span>
    A robust model will achieve similar accuracy for both the original dataset and perturbed dataset. If you model is not robust, the accuracy of the model will reduce with a perturbed dataset.

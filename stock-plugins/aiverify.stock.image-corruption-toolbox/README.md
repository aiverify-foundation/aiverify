# Image Corruption Toolbox

## Description
This plugin tests the robustness of AI models to natural corruptions. 

There are four different broad groups of corruptions that are packaged in this plugin. Each of these broad groups of corruptions also have more specific corruption functions indicated in brackets below:
- General (Gaussian, Poisson, Salt and Pepper Noise)
- Blur (Defocus, Gaussian, Glass, Horizontal Motion, Vertical Motion, Zoom Blur)
- Digital (Brightness Up and Down, Contrast Up and Down, Compression, Random Tilt, Saturate)
- Environmental (Rain, Fog, Snow)

The toolbox generates corrupted images based on the uploaded test data at 5 different severity levels for each corruption function. The accuracy of the model is calculated with the new corrupted datasets.

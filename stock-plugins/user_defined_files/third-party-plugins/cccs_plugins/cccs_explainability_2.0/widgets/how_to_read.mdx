        The y-axis represents the features. They are ranked from the highest to lowest contribution to the predictions. If the feature names are not given, they will be masked as Feature X (where X is a number) instead. The x-axis represents the absolute average SHAP values across all predictions. A higher value means that the feature had more influence on the predictions. The colours represent the output classes and the number of colours correspond to the number of unique output values in the predictions.

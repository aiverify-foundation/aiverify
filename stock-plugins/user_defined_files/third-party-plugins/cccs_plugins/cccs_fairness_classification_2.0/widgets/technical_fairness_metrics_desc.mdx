    <h3>Fairness for Classification</h3>
    The fairness test shows how correctly your model has predicted the selected sensitive feature(s) (Selected: {props.getResults(cid, gid).sensitive_feature.join(", ")}). These fairness metrics are calculated based on the performance measurement for classification models. The table shows a list of fairness metrics that are generated in this report.

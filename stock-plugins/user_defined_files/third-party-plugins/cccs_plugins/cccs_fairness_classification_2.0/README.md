# Fairness Metrics Toolbox for Classification

## Description

The Fairness Metrics Toolbox (FMT) for Classification contains a list of fairness metrics to measure how resources (e.g. opportunities, food, loan, medical help) are allocated among the demographic groups (e.g. married male, married female) given a set of sensitive feature(s) (e.g. gender, marital status). This plugin is developed for classification models.

## Using the Plugin in AI Verify
### Data Preparation
- Tabular dataset ([Tutorial for Preparation](https://aiverify-foundation.github.io/aiverify/getting-started/prepare-tabular/))

### Algorithm User Input(s)

|      Input Field       |            Description            |  Type   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | :-----: |
| Sensitive Feature Name | Array of sensitive features names </br> You may select multiple sensitive features of interest, and as a guide these are usually demographic features | `array` |

### Algorithm Input Block - Fairness Tree
The Fairness Tree helps you to select the most relevant fairness metrics for your use case. Read more on how to understand the fairness tree [here](https://aiverify-foundation.github.io/aiverify/how-to/use-fairness-tree/).

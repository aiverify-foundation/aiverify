AI Verify aims to help organisations validate the performance of their AI systems against a set of internationally recognised principles through standardised tests:
 <ul style={styles.list}>
 <li>the performance of their AI systems; and</li>
 <li>documentary evidence that their AI systems have been developed and deployed with processes designed to achieve the desired outcomes of these principles.</li>
 </ul>
 Companies can use the output from these tests to demonstrate their implementation of responsible AI and build trust with their stakeholders. Companies can also use the test results to identify potential gaps and take appropriate actions to address them, where applicable.
